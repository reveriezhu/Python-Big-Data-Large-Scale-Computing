To convert a text file into an RDD, we use the `SparkContext.textFile()` method. We also apply the recently defined `removePunctuation()` function using a `map()` transformation to strip out the punctuation and change all text to lower case.  Since the file is large we use `take(15)`, so that we only print 15 lines."
